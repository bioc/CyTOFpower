Description: This package is a tool to predict the power of CyTOF 
    experiments in the context of differential state analyses. The package provides 
    a shiny app with two options to predict the power of an experiment: 
    i. generation of in-sicilico CyTOF data, using users input ii. browsing in a 
    grid of parameters for which the power was already precomputed.
